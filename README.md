# Weathercan Missing Value Imputation App

## Overview

This Shiny application is designed to process CSV files generated by the [weathercan](https://github.com/ropensci/weathercan) R package. It provides a user-friendly interface to explore and impute missing values in climate station data using various statistical methods hosted here: [weathercan-imputation](https://raventools-weathercan-imputation.share.connect.posit.cloud).

## Features

**CSV File Upload**: Upload CSV files containing climate station data.
**Imputation Methods**: Choose from multiple imputation techniques:
  - Linear Regression
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
**Moving Average Smoothing**: Optionally apply a moving average to the imputed data.
**Date Handling**: Automatically parses and validates date columns.
**Variable Selection**: Select which variables to impute from the dataset.

## How It Works

**Upload CSV File**: Begin by uploading a CSV file generated by the `weathercan` package.
**Select Imputation Method**: Choose an imputation method from the available options.
**Configure Parameters**: Depending on the selected method, adjust relevant parameters such as the number of neighbors for KNN or the number of principal components for PCA.
**Apply Moving Average**: Optionally, apply a moving average to smooth the imputed data.
**View Results**: The app will display the imputed dataset, allowing you to download or further analyze the results.

## Installation

To run this application locally:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rarabzad1/weathercan_imputation.git
   cd weathercan_imputation
````

2. Install the required R packages:

```r
   install.packages(c("shiny", "weathercan", "imputeTS", "ggplot2"))
```

3. Launch the application:

   ```r
   shiny::runApp()
   ```

## Usage

* **File Input**: Upload a CSV file generated by the `weathercan` package.
* **Imputation Method**: Select an imputation method from the dropdown menu.
* **Moving Average**: Choose whether to apply a moving average after imputation.
* **Variable Selection**: Select which variables to impute.

## Example

An example CSV file can be generated using the `weathercan` package:

```r
library(weathercan)
stations <- stations_search("Waterloo")
data <- weather_dl(station_ids = stations$station_id[1], start = "2023-01-01", end = "2023-12-31")
write.csv(data, "waterloo_weather.csv")
```

Upload the `waterloo_weather.csv` file to the application and follow the on-screen instructions to impute missing values.

If you want, I can also add a **small introductory text under the app title** directly in the README so users see a quick explanation right away. Do you want me to do that?
