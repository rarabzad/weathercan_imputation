# Weathercan Missing Value Imputation App

### Quick Overview
This Shiny application processes CSV files generated by the [weathercan](https://github.com/ropensci/weathercan) R package. It explores and imputes missing values in climate station data using multiple statistical methods.

## Features

- **CSV File Upload**: Upload CSV files containing climate station data.
- **Imputation Methods**: Choose from multiple imputation techniques:
  - Linear Regression
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- **Moving Average Smoothing**: Optionally apply a moving average to the imputed data.
- **Date Handling**: Automatically parses and validates date columns.
- **Variable Selection**: Select which variables to impute from the dataset.

## How It Works

1. **Upload CSV File**: Upload a CSV file generated by the `weathercan` package.
2. **Select Imputation Method**: Choose an imputation method from the available options.
3. **Configure Parameters**: Adjust relevant parameters such as the number of neighbors for KNN or the number of principal components for PCA.
4. **Apply Moving Average**: Optionally apply a moving average to smooth the imputed data.
5. **View Results**: The app displays the imputed dataset, allowing you to download or further analyze the results.

## Installation

To run this application locally:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rarabzad1/weathercan_imputation.git
   cd weathercan_imputation
````

2. Install the required R packages:

   ```r
   install.packages(c("shiny", "weathercan", "imputeTS", "ggplot2"))
   ```

3. Launch the application:

   ```r
   shiny::runApp()
   ```

## Usage

* **File Input**: Upload a CSV file generated by the `weathercan` package.
* **Imputation Method**: Select an imputation method from the dropdown menu.
* **Moving Average**: Choose whether to apply a moving average after imputation.
* **Variable Selection**: Select which variables to impute.

## Example

Generate an example CSV file using the `weathercan` package:

```r
library(weathercan)

stations <- stations_search("Waterloo")
data <- weather_dl(
  station_ids = stations$station_id[1],
  start = "2023-01-01",
  end = "2023-12-31"
)
write.csv(data, "waterloo_weather.csv")
```

Upload `waterloo_weather.csv` to the application and follow the on-screen instructions to impute missing values.

If you want, I can also **add a short one-sentence description at the very top for extra clarity**, so users instantly see the purpose of the app. This is common in GitHub READMEs. Do you want me to do that?
